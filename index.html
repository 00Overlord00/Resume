               <div class=employmentBody1> 
               <p>-As a senior member of the staff, I helped integrate new ownership into their new-found roles by instructing them on current working methods, employee roles and responsibilities, “Point-of-Sales” system tutorials, and management protocol, resulting in a smooth transition between previous ownership and current.</p>
                <p>-Furthermore, by helping identify less productive methods in day-to-day logistics and processes and by collaborating to produce more effective ones, both management and staff increased productivity and sales.
               <p>-Working with management, I helped to generate new promotions, specials, and recipes and we were successful in attracting not only new customers, but a whole new demographic of customers.</p>

               <p>-I was also responsible for engaging customers who provided positive or negative feedback, assessing any inherent problems (in the case of the latter) and working to develop solutions to the mutual advantage of both customer and proprietor, maintaining customer satisfaction and producing repeat customers.</p>
